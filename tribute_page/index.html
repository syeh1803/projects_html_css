       <div id="tribute-info">
           <li>Musk loved “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,” as a boy and at age 12, he reportedly made a space-themed PC game called 'Blastar' which was sold to a magazine for $500.</li>
           <li>By 25, Musk had created Zip2, an online advertising platform, and was a millionaire by age 30 after selling the company to Compaq Computer in 1999.</li>
           <li>Musk followed that success with the creation of the online bank, X.com, which was later merged into PayPal which eBay bought in 2002 for $1.5 billion.</li>
           <li>Musk founded SpaceX, also known as Space Exploration Technologies Corp, in 2002. SpaceX is scheduled to launch two crewed flights for NASA in 2021, including one in the spring, and four cargo refueling missions over the next 15 months.</li>
           <li>Due to lack of funding, Musk invested his own money for the development of SpaceX rockets.</li>
           <li>After setting ambitious goals for the model's ramp-up, Musk hit a rough spot in 2018 as Tesla Motors, where he became a major funder, missed targets while burning through cash.</li>
           <li>In 2018, Musk jolted markets by announcing that he was considering taking Tesla private and said that he had "secured" financing for doing so. Musk quickly dropped the go-private effort, but became embroiled in a bitter dispute with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</li>
           <li>Musk has a baby with the most unusual name, which he shortens to “X.” Musk had said it’s pronounced “just like the letter X. AE is pronounced ‘ash’, as in Old English. A-12 is also pronounced just like it reads. Refers to the Archangel-12 CIA reconnaissance plane.”</li>
           <li>Musk made an appearance in "The Simpsons" episode, “The Musk Who Fell to Earth”.</li>
           <li>Musk publicly sparred with a British caver, who had mocked the Tesla CEO's offer of a mini-submarine to rescue young soccer players trapped in a cave in Thailand in the summer of 2018.</li>
